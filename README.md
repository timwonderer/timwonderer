## 🧠 About Me

I teach high school computer science and chemistry in a public school serving students from Central and South America. I also teach a graduate-level course on community inquiry and conduct research on teacher professional development, especially the role of micro-credentials in building educator efficacy.

I’m passionate about building tools that empower students — whether it’s a classroom economy app that simulates financial life, immersive Python-based assessments that unfold like science fiction, or integrating AI literacy into chemistry lessons.

## 🚧 Current Projects

### 🏛️ Classroom Economy System
A custom web platform (Flask + PostgreSQL) that models a student-driven economy:
- NFC-based tap-in/out attendance
- Rent, insurance, and property tax systems
- Bank accounts (checking/savings), salary, bonuses, and NSF fees
- Storefront + item usage approval flow
- Audit logs and admin dashboard

Currently testing:
- Bill payment flow
- Transaction voiding
- NSF escalation logic
- Desk ownership and store purchases

### 📡 AP CSP Narrative Assessments

I design storytelling-style assessments where students *interact* with the material instead of just answering it:
- 🪐 **"Is Leave Possible"** – Data storytelling with Python & Google Forms
- 📊 **"Fragments of Truth"** – Data Unit: Time-loop paradox + student-induced anomalies
- 🤖 **"The Halting Protocol"** (Under Development) – Algorithms Unit: Archivist AI and the halting problem


All projects blend Python (Trinket), narrative worldbuilding, and learning science.

### 🧮 Quadratic Formula Solver
A full-featured Python solver that:
- Uses custom square root simplification via prime factorization
- Reduces fractions via GCD
- Handles real and complex roots
- Outputs step-by-step symbolic breakdowns
